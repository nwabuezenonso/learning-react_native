# Some Explanation on react native
 in react native when we pass a function to onchange text, it takes in the value inside the text

 A map function cycle through the array and returns each function in the array and a style prop is a way to style a component

 A view style can not pass down to a text

 OnchangeText atomatically takes in the value of the text field.
